Project from Day 18 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp:
This code takes an image of Damien Hirst's Dot Paintings and stores the colors of the dots.
The stored colors are then used to generate a random painting similar to Damien Hirst's paintings.
This code uses Turtle Graphics for Python.
